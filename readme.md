# Semantic Grid System Demo

I find myself re-using a custom grid system, loosely based from [this example](http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/the-simpler-css-grid). However I like to keep my HTML semantic, taking hints from [this semantic system](http://semantic.gs/).

Run this sinatra app to see it in action.

**This is really old. I would advise against utilizing it for _anything_. However, I'm leaving it public as a testament to the gymnastics one had to perform before actually useful features like [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid), and utility frameworks like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) came into widespread use.**
